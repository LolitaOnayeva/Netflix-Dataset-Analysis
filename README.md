# Netflix-Dataset-Analysis

Here we will have a look at Netflix dataset. 

First, we looked at the average duration of the movies over the years. We wanted to have a look if the average duration increased. As the result, we see that the average duration has been increasing over the last decade. While exploring the dataset, we also noticed that the number of films released has significantly decresed in 2020. We assume that it is related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

We also looked at the LGBTQ movies. We discovered that the mojority of LGBTQ movies are available for the subscribers in United States. However, if we look at the percentage of LGBTQ movies to all genres available in US region, we see that it is only 2%. The most popular genre of movies(single) for US market is Stand-Up Comedy.
